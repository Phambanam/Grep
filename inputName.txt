I have a big family with six people.
I have two sisters and a brother.
My sisters are older and my brother is younger than me.
My father is a teacher at a secondary school.
He has worked for 35 years in the field and he is my biggest role model in life. My mother is a housewife.
She is nice and she is really good at cooking. I love my family so much.
I’m a generous and easy-going person but when it comes to work , a competitive perfectionist.
I’m also an optimistic and outgoing person so I have many friends and other social relationships.
I enjoy reading, writing and doing math.
I decided to become a Civil Engineer because I have always been fascinated by bridges, buildings, and skyscrapers.
A degree in Civil Engineering enables me to achieve my goals and also gives me an opportunity to make a difference in the community.
